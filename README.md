# cat-monitoring

WIP

Linux only (currently tested on raspberry pi 4 only, but without LED it should work on any linux)

Quick start:
1) git clone https://github.com/DotaPie/cat-monitoring.git
2) edit ./cat-monitoring/config.json (cams, ftp server, ...)
3) sudo bash ./cat-monitoring/src/install.sh

Note: for raspberry choose requirements-rpi.txt during running install script (will be prompted)
